Rig I Toni - Line Waiting App 

This application is for RIT students, and anyone else who is currently on campus who wants to get food, but wants to get it without the wait.

People will use this app to determine the best place to go to get food when they want. Upon opening the app, the program will get the time and tell them the length of the line at different places on campus. There is nothing similar already available. 

The majority of this work was done together. However, Josh and Xander worked on getting the time to work and display properly in the program. Michele worked on the moodboard and her and Josh worked on the design. Ella worked on organizing the restaurants in the program. Xander mostly added the restaurants to the dictionary, while Michele, Josh, and Ella organizing the code and setting up the dictionary. We all worked on the switch statements.

This application is easy to use, as there’s only one interactable piece of the program. It also accomplishes its goal in displaying the restaurant and if it is busy or not at the current time. 

For our above and beyond portion, we sent out a poll to the students of RIT in order to gauge their opinion on line wait times. Our results from the poll directly influenced the program. 

During the times from 10 am to 12 pm and 5 pm to 7 pm, peak line wait time is seen by the students. Thus, during these hours, the program notifies the user that the lines are long and they should not even bother going to places on campus unless they’re starving. At other times, the program notifies the user either that the line is short, or that the restaurant is closed.
